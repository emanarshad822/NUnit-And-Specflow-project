Cucumber-Style Test Automation with Page Object Model (POM)
This repository contains a test automation project demonstrating the use of Cucumber in a BDD-style format with feature files, step definitions, and the implementation of the Page Object Model (POM). The project is designed to showcase how to create and execute automated tests for web applications using Cucumber along with the POM pattern to enhance test maintainability and readability.

****Key Features****:

Cucumber BDD Integration: Utilizes Cucumber to write acceptance tests in a human-readable Gherkin syntax, enabling collaboration between stakeholders and automation engineers.

Feature Files: Includes feature files that describe various test scenarios and behaviors of the web application from a user's perspective.

Step Definitions: Implements step definitions that map each step in the feature files to automation code, allowing for the execution of test scenarios.

Page Object Model (POM): Adheres to the POM design pattern to organize and manage web elements and actions within page objects, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

Sample Tests: Provides sample test scenarios covering different functionalities of the web application, demonstrating the capabilities of Cucumber and POM.

Test Automation: Shows how to automate web application testing processes to ensure reliability and quality through automated tests.

****Usage****:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git.
Open the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
Install dependencies using your package manager (npm, yarn, etc.) if required.
Run the tests using the test runner integrated with your IDE or through the command line.
Review the test results and explore the sample tests to understand how Cucumber and POM are utilized for test automation.
